Overview
Welcome to the Smart Camera Decision Making AI repository! This project focuses on enhancing the capabilities of smart cameras by incorporating artificial intelligence for intelligent decision-making. The AI model is designed to analyze camera feeds and make informed decisions based on predefined criteria.

Features
Intelligent Object Recognition: The AI can accurately identify and classify objects within camera feeds, allowing for more nuanced decision-making.

Event Detection: The system is capable of detecting and flagging events of interest, such as suspicious activities or specific object movements.

Customizable Decision Rules: Users can define and customize decision rules to tailor the AI's behavior according to specific requirements and scenarios.

Real-time Decision Making: The AI operates in real-time, ensuring quick responses to changing situations and events within the camera's field of view.
